# Finding the Best Markets to Advertise In

* This is a guided project from DataQuest
* In this project I have cleaned, visualized, and ran summary statistics on the data from freeCodeCamp's 2017 New Coder Survey to find the best market to invest.
* You can find all the details in the notebook file.

# Conclusion  
* In this project, we analyzed survey data from new coders to find the best two markets to advertise in. The only solid conclusion we reached is that the US would be a good market to advertise in.

* For the second best market, it wasn't clear-cut what to choose between India and Canada. We decided to send the results to the marketing team so they can use their domain knowledge to take the best decision.
